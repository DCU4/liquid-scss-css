### Liquid SCSS to CSS
Turn your style.scss.liquid into style.css.liquid. Why? Shopify has <a href="https://www.shopify.com.au/partners/blog/deprecating-sass" target="_blank">deprecated Sass</a> and SCSS within their Themes.

Simply copy/paste your scss.liquid into the input field and compile or minify into css.liquid. 

Built on Node.js and uses gulp to compile.

### TODO
- ~Maybe set it up so users dont even need to double quote the SCSS~
- Set it up to work with comments, if statements, and other liquid
